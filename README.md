## Notes
* The modulo operator for python and C++ work differently for negative numbers. Because the exact operation of the modulo isn't issue, but being able to evaluate it I've decided to ignore the difference.
* Not Supported
    * Assignment Operators (+=, -=, etc.)
    * Increment/decrement (++, --)
