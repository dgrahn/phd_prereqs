# CWE 120/121/122: Buffer Overflow

| CWE   | Name |
|-------|------|
| 120   | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
| 787   | Out-of-bounds Write
| ↪ 121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow
| ↪ 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow

## Descriptions
**CWE 120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')**
> The program copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

**CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write**
> The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow**
> A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

**CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow**
> A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().


## Breakdown
### CWE-120
The program
* Copies ➡ Identify code that copies buffers
    * an input buffer, to ➡ Identify source buffer
    * an output buffer ➡ Identify target buffer
* Without verifying ➡ Identify absence of verification
    * less than ➡ Perform comparison of sizes
        * the size of the input buffer ➡ Identify size buffer
        * the size of the output buffer ➡ Identify size buffer

### CWE-121
The software
* Writes data to ➡ Identify code that writes to a buffer
    * a stack-based buffer (e.g. local variable, parameter to function) ➡ Identify stack-based buffers
    to a location that is ➡ Identify location in buffer being written
        * past the end, or ➡ Identify size of buffer, perform comparison
        * before the beginning ➡ Identify size of buffer, perform comparison to 0

### CWE-122
The software
* Writes data to ➡ Identify code that writes to a buffer
    * a heap-based buffer (e.g. memory allocated via routine such as malloc) ➡ Identify heap-based buffers
    to a location that is ➡ Identify location in buffer being written
        * past the end, or ➡ Identify size of buffer, perform comparison
        * before the beginning ➡ Identify size of buffer, perform comparison to 0

## Prerequisite Tasks
* Identify code that copies buffers (120)
* Identify buffer usage (120, 121, 122)
    * Identify source & target buffers (120)
    * Identify stack-based buffers (121)
    * Identify heap-based buffers (122)
* Identify absence of size verification (120)
* Identify size of buffer (120, 121, 122)
* Identify location being written (121, 122)
* Perform comparison between identified sizes (120, 121, 122)
* Perform comparison between identified size and zero (121, 122)
