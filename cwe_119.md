## Descriptions
**CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**
> The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

**CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')**
> The program copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

**CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')**
> The software writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

**CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read**
> The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**CWE-126: Buffer Over-read**
> The software reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

**CWE-415: Double Free**
> The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.

**CWE-416: Use After Free**
> Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code.

**CWE-466: Return of Pointer Value Outside of Expected Range**
> A function can return a pointer to memory that is outside of the buffer that the pointer is expected to reference.

**CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow**
> The product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.

**CWE-785: Use of Path Manipulation Function without Maximum-sized Buffer**
> The software invokes a function for normalizing paths or file names, but it provides an output buffer that is smaller than the maximum possible size, such as PATH_MAX.

**CWE-786: Access of Memory Location Before Start of Buffer**
> The software reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

**CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write**
> The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer**
> The software reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.

**CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value**
> The software uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.

**CWE-806: Buffer Access Using Size of Source Buffer**
> The software uses the size of a source buffer when reading from or writing to a destination buffer, which may cause it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.

**CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference**
> The program obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.

**CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset**
> The program performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.

**CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer**
> The program accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

**CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference**
> The program dereferences a pointer that contains a location for memory that was previously valid, but is no longer valid.
